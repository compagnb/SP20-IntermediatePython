### Course Breakdown:
#### [Week 1: Review](notes/wk1.md)
* Functions
* Variables & Scope
* Lists
* **In-class Exercises/Challenges**: 
	* Create a program to calculate our weight on the moon (or any planet):
        * Create function to take the starting weight and increase the weight each year
        * Modify the function so that you can change the amount of years
        * Take input from the user for each and then display how much the user would weigh
    * Code:
    	* [Basic Moon Code](codeExercises/wk1_basicMoon.py)
    	* [Building Functions With Moon Code](codeExercises/wk1_moonFunction.py)
    	* [Completed Moon Scale](codeExercises/wk1_moonScale.py)
    	* [Completed Planet Scale](codeExercises/wk1_planetScale.py)

#### [Week 2: Turtle & Functions](notes/wk2.md)
* Libraries & Modules
* Classes & Objects in Pictures
* Functions
* For Loops
* **In-class Exercises/Challenges**: 
	* Using the turtle class
		* Draw a square that allows options for where on the screen the shape will be drawn (x position & y position), size, and fill color. 
    	* Draw a circle that allows options for where on the screen the shape will be drawn (x position & y position), size, and fill color. 
    	* Draw a star that allows options for where on the screen the shape will be drawn (x position & y position), number of points, size, and fill color. 
        (Make sure that the turtle does not draw a line when moving to the place that the shapes will be drawn)
    * Code:
    	* [Basic Rectangle Code](codeExercises/wk2_rectangle.py)
    	* [Basic Triangle Code](codeExercises/wk2_triangle.py)
    	* [Octogon Function & For Loop Code](codeExercises/wk2_Octogon.py)
    	* [Completed Shapes Function Code](codeExercises/wk2_Shapes.py)
        * [More Example Code with Functions](codeExercises/)

#### [Week 3: Classes & Objects](notes/wk3.md)
* Adding Objects to Classes
* Adding Class Characteristics as Functions
* Functions Calling Functions
* Initializing An Object
* Children & Parents
* Inherited Functions
* **In-class Exercises/Challenges**: 
	* Create a class named Giraffe. 
        * Give the class functions that represent things a giraffe would do. (i.e. eat, sleep, left foot forward, right foot forward, etc.)
        * Make a function within the Giraffe class to make the giraffe dance by calling other functions within the class. 
        * Make an instance of the Giraffe, and make the instance dance.
        * Make two instances and make them both do different things. 
        * Make two instances of the Giraffe class, that have a different number of spots (characteristics).
